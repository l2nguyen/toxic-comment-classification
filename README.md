# Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification
My attempt at a competition using text data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/). The goal of this competition is to use a model to classify into different types of toxicity based on the content of the post. I chose this competition because I wanted to practice working with text data and NLP.
